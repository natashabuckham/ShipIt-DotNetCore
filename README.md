# ShipIt Inventory Management

## Setup Instructions
Open the project in VSCode.
VSCode should automatically set up and install everything you'll need apart from the database connection!

### Setting up the Database.
Create 2 new postgres databases - one for the main program and one for our test database.
Ask a team member for a dump of the production databases to create and populate your tables.

Then for each of the projects, add a `.env` file at the root of the project.
That file should contain a property named `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING`.
It should look something like this:
```
POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING=Server=127.0.0.1;Port=5432;Database=your_database_name;User Id=your_database_user; Password=your_database_password;
```

## Running The API
Once set up, simply run dotnet run in the ShipIt directory.

## Running The Tests
To run the tests you should be able to run dotnet test in the ShipItTests directory.

## changing the employee to have identity 
1. change sql db load to add new column which autogenrates the id
2. return id, employee when get employee is call - this will show if multiple employees with same name (getEmployeeByName needs to return a list)
3. run the test - this should not fail because id is autogenerated
4. change the primary key to be the id
5. create an index on name so that search is faster
